This project is a Codewars Leaderboard. You can put in a list of usernames, and the website will get their latest scores from Codewars.

It shows:

--Username, clan, and score of each user

--A drop-down to see scores by programming language or overall score

--The top user is highlighted with emojis

The project also shows error messages if a user does not exist or if something goes wrong.
